        <h1>What is Aqua X?</h1>
        <p>
            Aqua X is an amazing water filter built with four to five sections, which filter water to 0.5 microns. 
            This filter consists of pebbles and sand which are able to trap particles within the water such as 
            coarse rocks, fine rocks, coarse sand, and fine sand. It also has a sieve to remove big rocks that are 
            in the water. Another section has activated charcoal that balances the Ph of the water and filters the
            water to 0.5 microns. Further, this filter also contains zeolite balls which remove the chlorine and
            lead from the water, thus this filter can also be used by people in developed countries like Canada, 
            which have water with lead contamination. Another section this filter has contains copper. Finally 
            there is a little tap from which you can access the water when it is filtered.

        <h1>How is Aqua X unique?</h1>
        <p>
            Our product is unique because it purifies the water of many impurities using a simple system, 
            unlike others. It has different sections that use many different purifying substances used from
            a variety of different filters such as Brita®️. We use other basic and essential items to purify 
            the water like the copper, sand, and pebbles.

        <h1>Who are we targeting?</h1>
        <p>
            Our target audience is poor countries in the world that can’t afford or have to travel long miles 
            to get unpurified water from lakes, rivers, and even trashed up oceans. These countries include 
            India, parts of Africa, Indonesia, etc. We believe that if all these people have to go through the 
            struggle of getting water, they should have at least clean water. Our product will help many 
            people to get better water, and also save people from dying. We are also trying to make the product 
            quite cheap, but still, make a reasonable profit.
